// Messages left on buildings in Aeon City / Whale City.
//
// ⭐ THE NOTES LIVE ON-CHAIN, NOT WITH US. A note is a transaction to CityNotes.sol, which emits it
// as an event and stores nothing. We run no database, no endpoint and no key, and there is nothing
// of ours to trust: anyone can read the same logs and rebuild this noticeboard exactly.
//
// That also removes the weakest part of the first design. When a message was a signature checked in
// the browser, a browser could be told to skip the check, so a server would eventually have had to
// re-verify everything. A transaction can't be forged — `msg.sender` IS the proof — so the
// verification problem doesn't get deferred, it disappears.
//
// What does NOT disappear:
//   • Permanence. Nobody can delete a note, us included. We can only stop rendering it. Moderation
//     moves from "what we keep" to "what we display" — validateMessage is now a DISPLAY FILTER
//     rather than a gate. Someone can write a link on-chain; the city won't show it.
//   • Ownership. The contract can't know who holds AEON or SPX, so "only residents get a sign" is
//     applied at render time by the city, not at write time by the chain.
//
// Reading follows the same snapshot-forward pattern as every other series here: a daily job banks
// the logs into public/city-notes.json, and a wallet's own fresh note is echoed locally so it shows
// up immediately instead of tomorrow.

// colour alone, because "grey versus blue" is not a distinction everyone can see.

// Colours are this repo's existing per-chain convention (the multichain card): Ethereum grey, Base
