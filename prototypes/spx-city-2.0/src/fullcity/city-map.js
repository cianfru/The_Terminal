// says nothing about where anyone actually is. Fun on top, never a claim the data can't make.

// (© OpenStreetMap contributors, ODbL), so the shape, the tilt, Central Park and the surrounding
// boroughs are true geometry rather than a sketch — with no map dependency, key or per-load cost.

// with a thin moat around it. This is the SAME trap already documented for Manhattan, where the
// admin relation was swapped for the natural "Manhattan Island" feature; the boroughs were never
// re-fetched.
//
// The proper fix is to re-fetch each borough's natural coastline. Overpass is unreachable from the
// build sandbox (the network policy 504s it), so instead of inventing shorelines we paint the KNOWN
// water bodies back on TOP of the boroughs, traced from real coordinates. Honest scope: these are
// hand-entered and are SCENERY ONLY — no wallet is ever placed on or near them, and nothing is
// measured from them. 🔲 Replace with real coastlines when OSM is reachable.
//
// ONLY the harbour is patched, deliberately. A first pass also blocked in the Lower Bay and Jamaica
// Bay as rectangles, and they rendered as exactly that — hard straight edges across the sea, which
// looked more wrong than the error they were fixing. The harbour survives because it is traced
// along real shorelines on both banks and lands where the eye already expects water. Distance haze
// handles everything further out, which is honest: it hides the far geography rather than

// ⭐ THE WATERFRONT PIERS. Manhattan's edge is famously serrated — the finger piers of the Hudson
// and East River are as much of its outline from above as the street grid is — and ours was a
// perfectly smooth coastline, which is the tell that the shape is traced rather than lived on.
//
// A pier is a flat deck reaching out from the shore into open water. They go along the long river
// shores only (an edge running roughly parallel to the island's axis), never around the tips, and
// every one is checked to make sure its far end lands in WATER — the Harlem River and the East River
// above Long Island City are narrow enough that a pier there would drive into Brooklyn or the Bronx,
// exactly the trap the borough lot-grid hit. Decks come back as world-coordinate rings and render
// through the same flat() path as the shoreline, so they sit on the water at any city scale.
