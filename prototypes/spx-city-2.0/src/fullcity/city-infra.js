//
// The city started as a map of Ethereum holders, which is 667M of a 931M supply. This is the other
// 264M: the coins sitting on exchanges, in the Uniswap pool, locked in the bridge that backs Base
// and Solana, and the 69M that were burned. Rendered as the infrastructure a real port city has —
// docks, a bridge, a monument — so the whole supply is visible in one place instead of split
// between a map and four separate charts.
//
// EVERY SITE IS WHERE THE REAL THING IS. The port sits off Red Hook, which is New York's actual
// container terminal. The bridge runs the Brooklyn Bridge's line. The monument stands on Liberty
// Island. None of that is decoration — placing them correctly is what stops the city becoming a
// diagram with a New York skin, and it means anyone who knows the city can check us.
//
// The honest framing, which belongs on the page: the SUPPLIES, the venues and the bridge are real
// and checkable. Which borough stands for which chain is a game.
