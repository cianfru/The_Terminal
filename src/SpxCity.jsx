// ⭐ THE RULE THAT MADE THE MERGE POSSIBLE: ONE RESIDENCY RULE PER MODE, AND HEIGHT ALWAYS COMES
// FROM THE ASSET THE MODE IS ABOUT. The old Aeon page had an "AEON + SPX" toggle that folded a
// wallet's SPX balance into its height by rescaling it onto the NFT axis. That was a presentational
// choice, not a measurement — there is no honest exchange rate between "148 NFTs" and "14M tokens".
// It was defensible as a labelled overlay on a dedicated page; it is not defensible sitting next to
// two modes that mean something.
//
// So BOTH mode is a FILTER, never a blend: it is the SPX city, restricted to the residents who also
// collect AEON. Height means exactly what it means in SPX mode. That keeps the promise the whole
// city rests on — being in it always says the same thing about you — true inside every mode, which
// a blended axis would have quietly broken.
