// WHAT IS ACTUALLY DEPLOYED RIGHT NOW.
//
// "The site looks stale" has come up more than once, and each time answering it meant
// diffing bytes by hand against the repo. That is a slow way to settle a question with a
// factual answer, and it cannot be done at all from a phone. So the build stamps the
// commit it was built from into /version.json and into the console banner.
//
// Now the check is: open spx6900rainbow.xyz/version.json. If the sha matches the newest
// commit, the deploy is fine and anything stale on screen is a cache between you and the
// edge. If it does not match, the deploy genuinely did not land, and the sha it reports
// says exactly which build is being served — which is the thing worth knowing.
//
// GITHUB_SHA is set in CI; git is the fallback for a local build.
