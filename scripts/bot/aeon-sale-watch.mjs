// ============================================================================
// PROJECT AEON — notable-sale watcher
// ============================================================================
// Posts when a genuinely notable AEON sale lands: the piece itself, what it fetched,
// and how that compares to what its rarity normally trades at.
//
// LANES, not one global slot. The bot used to allow one post per day across everything,
// which meant a real event had to wait for tomorrow if the rotation had already gone out.
// Each lane now carries its own budget (see postLane/lanePostedToday in posts.mjs), so a
// rainbow band crossing and a notable sale can both fire on the same day as the daily —
// but each is still capped at one per day and gated on being genuinely notable.
//
// Notability (any one, evaluated against sales from the last NOTABLE_DAYS):
//   • a STEAL      — sold >=20% under what that rarity trades at
//   • a RARE piece — rank <= 150 changing hands at all (they seldom do)
//   • a BIG sale   — >=2x the current market level
// Ties break on the strongest signal. Already-posted token/date pairs are remembered in
// public/aeon-sale-state.json, so the same sale never fires twice.
//
// Runs after the Aeon banker rebuilds aeon-market.json (aeon.yml), and on dispatch.
// DRY_RUN=1 does detection + card render only, writing aeon-sale-preview.png.
