//   node scripts/audit-feeds.mjs            # full check, exits 1 on a FAIL

//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. There are now ~20 data files written by 8 workflows off a dozen
// upstreams, and the failure that matters is not a workflow going red — it is a
// workflow going GREEN while one field inside its output quietly stops arriving.
// That is not hypothetical: the exchange-balance fields (cexBal/lpBal/custBal) were
// null for every one of the 53 days they existed, because the RPC behind them
// answered 521 and the fetch soft-failed to null with a console.warn nobody reads.
// The file's date looked perfect the whole time. So a check on file dates alone is
// exactly the check that would have missed it.
//
// Hence the three questions asked per feed, in order of how easily each is missed:
//   1. STALE    — is the date inside the file older than its cadence allows?
//   2. MISSING  — is a field the cards read absent from the recent window?
//   3. FROZEN   — is a field present but identical for the whole window (a
//                 forward-fill or a cached upstream masquerading as fresh data)?
//
// A field is `soft` when null is a legitimate answer (SOPR is null in a week where
// nothing moved; a signals list is usually empty). Soft fields report but never fail.
//
// ADDING A FEED: add an entry below. If a file is not listed here it is reported as
// UNTRACKED rather than ignored, so a new feed cannot slip in unaudited.
