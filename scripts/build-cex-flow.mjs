// Build the CEX / LP supply + flow series from the FIFO engine's reconstructed public/onchain.json.
//
// WHY THIS CHANGED (2026-08-28): it used to read a FROZEN Dune extract (dune/out/spx6900_cex_lp_flows.csv)
// for the historical baseline, then snapshot-forward. That baseline was queried with whatever address
// set existed at extract time, so every time a wallet was added to EXCLUDE_LABELS WITHOUT re-running the
// Dune query, the level silently understated — the rebase dragged the true live level down onto the stale
// baseline (118M vs a true 163M in Jul-2026; ~168M vs 190M after the 2026-08-28 Bubblemaps sweep). The
// FIFO engine already recomputes row.cexBal / row.lpBal for EVERY day of the full transfer archive using
// the CURRENT EXCLUDE_LABELS (build-onchain-local.mjs), so onchain.json is a fully-reconstructed, always-
// current, Dune-free source. We read it directly — one source of truth, no seam, no re-extract needed.
//
// NOTE (2026-10-01): a big fill is NOT necessarily a listing. Checked against listing dates — Kraken listed 2024-12-11 but its
// +62M fills are 2025-09-15/22 (single wallets into new Kraken wallets); Bybit listed 2024-11-21, its +23.7M fill is 2025-07-10.
// ONBOARDING vs ORGANIC: onchain.json is an AGGREGATE daily level, so we can't split by per-address age
// like the old per-wallet CSV. Instead we flag a day whose CEX balance STEPS UP by more than ONBOARD_STEP
// as a one-time new-wallet fill (a fresh venue wallet filling zero→millions in a day) and grey
// it; everything else is organic behavioural flow. Approximate, but it matches the intent — grey the big
// one-off fill spikes so the real deposit/withdrawal behaviour underneath stays visible.
//
// Output shape is UNCHANGED so the two exchange-flow cards + charts read it as-is:
//   row = [dayISO, cexBal, lpBal, custodyBal(=0, custody is folded into cex now), cexOrganicNet, cexOnboardNet, price]
